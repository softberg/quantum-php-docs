# Views

Views are the part of the Quantum PHP Framework responsible for presenting output to the user.

In a typical web request, the controller gathers data, then hands that data to the view layer to render the final HTML.

## Core idea

A view is where presentation happens.

A simple web flow looks like this:

1. a route matches
2. a controller action runs
3. the controller prepares data for the page
4. the view renders that data into HTML
5. the response sends the final result

## Views are a first-class system in Quantum

From the upstream framework code, Quantum has an explicit `View` subsystem instead of treating views as raw file includes.

The view layer supports:

- layout rendering
- partial rendering
- view parameters
- asset registration
- view cache integration
- XSS filtering during rendering

That makes it a structured rendering system, not just template fragments.

## A layout must be set for full rendering

In Quantum's `View` class, full `render()` expects a layout to be set first.

That is why the upstream web controller template uses a `__before()` hook like this:

```php
public function __before(ViewFactory $view)
{
    $view->setLayout('layouts/main', [
        // assets...
    ]);
}
```

Then the action can render the page itself:

```php
public function index(Response $response, ViewFactory $view)
{
    $view->setParams([
        'title' => config()->get('app.name'),
    ]);

    $response->html($view->render('index'));
}
```

This is the basic Quantum pattern for web pages.

## View parameters

Quantum views can receive parameters before rendering.

The view layer supports methods such as:

- `setParam()`
- `setParams()`
- `getParam()`
- `getParams()`

This allows controllers to pass data into the template cleanly.

## Partial rendering

Quantum also supports partial rendering through `renderPartial()`.

That is useful for smaller reusable fragments that should not render through the full layout pipeline.

In practice, this helps keep page templates cleaner and more modular.

## Shared and module-specific views

From the project skeleton and module templates, Quantum supports both shared and module-specific view locations.

Shared project views exist under:

```text
shared/views/
```

Module templates place views under:

```text
modules/<ModuleName>/src/Views/
```

This is a practical split:

- shared views for project-wide or reusable rendering concerns
- module views for module-specific pages and UI pieces

## What module views look like

The upstream module templates include real view structure such as:

- `Views/layouts/main.php`
- `Views/pages/...`
- `Views/partials/...`
- page-level view files like `index.php`

That means a Quantum web module is designed to support:

- layouts
- pages
- partials
- reusable UI fragments

## Assets in the view layer

The upstream web controller template registers assets when setting the layout.

That means view rendering and asset inclusion are intentionally connected.

In practice, the layout can then output registered assets with helper calls.

So a Quantum page is not just HTML content, it can also pull in CSS and JavaScript through the structured rendering flow.

## View caching

Quantum also includes view cache support.

Project-level view cache configuration lives in:

```text
shared/config/view_cache.php
```

From the framework code, if view cache is enabled, rendered layout output can be cached by route URI.

That means the view layer can participate directly in performance optimization.

## XSS filtering

The framework's `View` class applies XSS filtering to string parameters during rendering.

That matters because it shows Quantum is trying to make default rendering safer, not just more convenient.

## Renderer configuration

Project-level view renderer configuration lives in:

```text
shared/config/view.php
```

The project skeleton currently defines:

- a default renderer of `html`
- Twig-related configuration options as well

This suggests Quantum is designed to support more than one rendering mode, even if the default project uses the HTML renderer first.

## Practical view

A useful way to think about views in Quantum is:

- controllers prepare the data
- views render the presentation
- layouts wrap the page
- partials keep templates reusable
- assets and caching are part of the rendering system, not bolted on later

## What to read next

After views, the next best topic is modules, because Quantum uses modules as a major organizing unit for routes, controllers, views, and related code.
